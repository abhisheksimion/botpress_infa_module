## Actions

Everytime the server is started, Actions that you put in this folder will be copied in the `data/global/actions/infa-module/` folder.
They will overwrite existing files only if they haven't been edited manually.

Actions added this way will be avaialble on the flow editor using `infa-module/your-action-name`

Check the documentation for more informations about [Actions](https://botpress.io/docs/build/code/#actions)
